# MLDPStrokePredict
Stroke Predictor

Stroke Predictor is able to predict one's stroke based on important factors contributing to stroke based on the dataset.

A word document report is in this Git repository (2101806D_Zhang Haorui_Report.docx).

A presentation file is also in the Git repository (2101806D_ZhangHaorui_PPTSlides.pptx). 

These documents are based on my Machine Learning insights when drafting the project.
